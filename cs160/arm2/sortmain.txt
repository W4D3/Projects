SORT1:
In sortmain.cpp the first thing the driver does is generate a random 
number using srand(time(NULL)). Next, if the user of the program 
enters more than one command line argument the program will convert 
the second argument (argv[1]) on the command line to an integer. 
Next the createList(listA, N) and createList(listB, N) functions use 
a for loop to initialize each element of the lists. The for loop 
reads through each element and initializes a random number that is 
ANDed with 0xff (the value 255) into each spot.

SORT2:
The two for loops are used to get two element spots that are above
and below linearly. The first loop will change the element of the list 
to j which is n-1 and then it will decrement j at the end of the call. 
The second for loop will change the element of the list to k which is
j - 1 and then it will decrement k at the end of the call. Thus, the
if statement compares the two spots of the list and puts the lower value
in the spot that is before the higher value using a tempary value swap.
This will change the lower value into the spot before the higher value 
and the entire list will be sorted low to high.
