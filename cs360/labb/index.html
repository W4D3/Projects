<hr>

The layout of this lab is like
<a href=http://www.cs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread4/lecture.html>thread 
lecture four</a>.  I have written a driver program and a header file.  These are in
<b><a href=elevator_skeleton.c>elevator_skeleton.c</a></b>
and
<b><a href=elevator.h>elevator.h</a></b>.  You are not allowed to modify these
files.  These drive a simulation for 
of a building with multiple floors and a bunch of elevators.  As with 
<a href=http://www.cs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread4/lecture.html>thread 
lecture four</a>, there are some procedures defined in 
<b><a href=elevator.h>elevator.h</a></b> that you have to implement.  The other 
procedures are implemented in 
<b><a href=elevator_skeleton.c>elevator_skeleton.c</a></b>.
Before going over all of these, we have to talk about some helper files and programs.
<hr>
<h3>Helper Files/Programs</h3>

There are six helper files/programs:
<UL>
<LI> 
<b><a href=finesleep.h>finesleep.h</a></b> and
<b><a href=finesleep.c>finesleep.c</a></b>.  These define four procedures
that we use to sleep for sub-second intervals.  I wrote this before <b>usleep()</b>
became standard, and I don't want to change it -- 
you can use <b>select()</b>
to sleep for finer intervals than seconds (although, of course, there are limitations).
I've hacked up a little library that does this reasonably well.  I wouldn't
trust it enough to put it into the code for steering airplanes or running
artificial hearts, but I trust it enough for this lab.  The procedures are:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
void *finesleep_initialize(int cheat);          /* Initialize structures */
void finesleep_sleep(void *fs, double time);    /* Sleep for the given time */
double finesleep_time(void *fs);                /* Return the time since you initialized */
void finesleep_free(void *a);                   /* Destroy data structures and free memory */
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The <b>cheat</b> variable is to deal with the fact that very small sleep times don't
work too well.  In particular, the system call overhead and context switching overhead
mean that you end up not sleeping long enough at times and sleeping too much at 
times.  Specifically, two consecutive sleeps for time <i>x</i> return significantly 
after one sleep for time <i>2x</i>.  If you set <b>cheat</b> to one, then 
the time becomes slightly virtualized, and sleep calls return in the order in which
they should.
<p>
<LI> <b><a href=names.h>names.h</a></b>: This is a header file that defines two
arrays of first and last names.  Both are of size 200 and are nice for generating
random names for people.  The first names come from the most popular girl and boy
names of 2008.  The last names are random words.
<p>
<LI> <b><a href=makefile>makefile</a></b>: A makefile.  
<p>
<LI> <b><a href=elevator_null.c>elevator_null.c</a></b>: This is a solution that
compiles, but won't run.
<p>
<LI> <b><a href=reorder.c>reorder.c</a></b>: This makes sure that the output of 
a simulation prints events in ascending time.  This is because threads sometimes
execute out of order.
<p>
<LI> <b><a href=double-check.c>double-check.c</a></b>: This double-checks the output
of the simulation to make sure that it's legal.  In other words, people get on elevators
that are on their floor with the door open, etc.  Your simulations should be double-checked
by this program (after running <b>reorder</b>).
</UL>
<hr>
<h3>Structure of the Simulation</h3>

<b><a href=elevator_skeleton.c>Elevator_skeleton.c</a></b> defines a <b>main()</b>
routine that is called as follows:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
usage: elevator nfloors nelevators interarrival opentime floor_to_floor duration seed
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The command line arguments are:
<UL>
<LI> <b>nfloors</b>: The number of floors in our building.  It must be greater than one.
The building will have floors one through <b>nfloors</b>.
<LI> <b>nelevators</b>: The number of elevators in our building.  It must be greater than zero.
<LI> <b>interarrival</b>: This is the average interarrival times of people who want
to take an elevator.  People will be generated according to an exponential distributed
with this mean interarrival time.
<LI> <b>opentime</b>: This is the time, in seconds, that it takes an elevator to open 
its door, or to close its door.  This is a <b>double</b> greater than zero.
<LI> <b>floor_to_floor</b>: This is the time, in seconds, that it takes an elevator to
move from one floor to an adjacent floor. This is a <b>double</b> greater than zero.
<LI> <b>duration</b>: This is the duration, in seconds, of our simulation.  
This is another <b>double</b> greater than zero.
<LI> <b>seed</b>: Random number seed.
</UL>

The way the simulation works is that each elevator and person is its own thread.
Each elevator starts the simulation on floor 1 with its door closed, and can
hold an infinite number of people.
People are generated randomly, with random first and last names.  Each last name
is appended with an ascending number, so that person names are unique.  One third
of the people will start at floor 1 and go to another floor.  Another third will 
start on a floor higher than floor 1 and go to floor 1.  The remaining third go 
from one random floor to another.  
<p>
To go from one floor to another, an elevator must go to the person's initial floor
and open its door.  The person gets on the elevator, and the elevator must close its
door.  The person gets off the elevator when it is at the person's destination floor
with its door open.  The person then leaves the simulation.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>An Example</h3>
Let's look at a few examples.  In this first example, we simulate a building with 
five floors and one elevator.  It takes one second to open and close doors, and to
move from one floor to the next.  People arrive with a mean interarrival time of
five seconds.  We simulate for 20 seconds:

UNIX> <b></b>
</pre>

Seven people enter the building in this simulation:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
   0.937: Sofia Riley(0) arrives at floor 01 wanting to go to floor 04.
   6.828: Christopher Naivete(1) arrives at floor 02 wanting to go to floor 03.
   9.335: Devin Exploration(2) arrives at floor 02 wanting to go to floor 01.
   9.768: Claire Describe(3) arrives at floor 03 wanting to go to floor 01.
  13.972: Savannah Buffet(4) arrives at floor 01 wanting to go to floor 05.
  15.480: Jonathan Magpie(5) arrives at floor 02 wanting to go to floor 04.
  15.609: Jason Stanch(6) arrives at floor 01 wanting to go to floor 05.
</pre></td></table></center><p>

At time 0.937, the elevator opens its door.  This takes a second, and at time 1.937,
Sofia Riley gets on the elevator.  It takes one second to close the door and four
seconds to get to floor four, so at time 6.937, the elevator arrives at floor 4, and
at time 7.937 its door is open and Sofia Riley gets out.
<p>
Next, it closes the door and travels to floor 2 to pick up the second person,
Christopher Naivete.  It arrives there with the door open at time 10.937.
It closes the door and takes him to his destination, arriving at time
13.937.  At that point, it travels back to floor 2 to get the third person,
Devin Exploration.  Note that it could have picked up Claire Describe at that
point, since she is on floor 3 wanting to get to floor 1.  However, this is a
relatively naive simulation (perhaps written by Christopher's relatives).  It
arrives at floor 2 for Devin at time 16.937 and spits him out at time 19.937.
By the time it gets its door closed, the simulation is over. 
<p>
<hr>
<h3>The structs in elevator.h</h3>

<b><a href=elevator.h>Elevator.h</a></b> defines three structures.  The
first contains the parameters for the simulation, the number of people 
during the simulation, and a lock for updating those variables.  It also
contains a <b>(void *)</b> that you can define and use.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
typedef struct {
  int nfloors; 
  int nelevators;
  double interarrival_time;   /* The interarrival time of people */
  double door_time;           /* The time to open or close a door */
  double floor_to_floor_time; /* The time to go from one floor to an adjacent floor */
  int npeople_started;        /* Stats. */
  int npeople_finished;
  pthread_mutex_t *lock;
  void *v;                    /* This is what you get to define */
} Elevator_Simulation;
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The <b>Elevator</b> struct also contains straightforward parameters.
It has a pointer to the main <b>Elevator_Simulation</b> struct for
the simulation, and each elevator has its own <b>(void *)</b> that you
can define and use.  The <b>lock</b> and <b>cond</b> are for you to
use to protect the elevator's data and to block when you have to block.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
typedef struct {
  int id;             /* Elevator id */
  int onfloor;        /* What floor the elevator is currently on */
  int door_open;      /* Whether the door is open */
  int moving;         /* Whether the elevator is moving */
  Dllist people;      /* Dllist of people on the elevator */
  pthread_mutex_t *lock;    
  pthread_cond_t *cond;    
  void *v;
  Elevator_Simulation *es;
} Elevator;
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The <b>Person</b> struct also contains mostly straightforward data.
The <b>Elevator</b> is the pointer to the elevator that will take 
the person to his/her destination floor.  It will be set when the
person gets on the elevator.  When that happens, <b>ptr</b> is set
so that the person may be deleted quickly from the elevator's list of
people.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
typedef struct {
  char *fname;           /* Person's first name */
  char *lname;           /* Person's last name */
  int from;              /* Starting floor */
  int to;                /* Ending floor */
  double arrival_time;   /* When the person will arrive at "from" */
  Elevator *e;           /* The person's elevator */
  Dllist ptr;            /* Pointer to the person's entry on the elevator's dllist */
  pthread_mutex_t *lock;    
  pthread_cond_t *cond;    
  void *v;
  Elevator_Simulation *es;
} Person;
</pre></td></table></center><p>


<hr>
<h3>The procedures in elevator.h and elevator_skeleton.c</h3>

First, let's take a look at the <b>main()</b> procedure.  This of course
reads the command line arguments and sets up the simulation's data.
At that point, it calls the procedure <b>initialize_simulation()</b> so
that you can initialize your <b>(void *)</b>.
<p>
It then creates <b>Elevator</b> structs for all the elevators and
calls <b>initialize_elevator()</b> on each in case you want to use the
elevator's <b>(void *)</b>.  Note that this is done before the elevator's
thread is created.  After creating each elevator, it creates a thread
calling the procedure <b>elevator()</b> with the elevator as an argument.
You get to write <b>elevator()</b>.
<p>
After creating the elevators, it creates a person generator thread, which 
sleeps and generates people at random times according to the <b>interarrival</b>
parameter.  Finally, the <b>main()</b> thread sleeps until the simulation is
over, at which time it prints out the final line and kills the program.
<p>
A note about sleeping -- all sleeping is done using <b>finesleep</b> and a 
global variable <b>FINESLEEPER</b>.  All sleeping is performed in <b>elevator_skeleton.c</b>,
and you are not allowed to do any sleeping in your programs.  
<p>
The person generating thread is straightforward.  It sleeps for a random amount
of time, and then generates a random person.  It then calls <b>initialize_person</b>
in case you want to initialize the person's <b>(void *)</b>.  Then it creates
a thread running the procedure <b>person()</b>.
<p>
All threads are detached when they are created so that we don't have to worry about
joining threads.
<p>
Now, let's take a detailed look at <b>person()</b>, defined in
<b><a href=elevator_skeleton.c>elevator_skeleton.c</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
void *person(void *arg)
{
  Person *p;

  p = (Person *) arg;

  pthread_mutex_lock(p-&gt;es-&gt;lock);
  p-&gt;es-&gt;npeople_started++;
  printf("%8.3lf: %s %s arrives at floor %02d wanting to go to floor %02d.\n", 
         finesleep_time(FINESLEEPER), 
         p-&gt;fname, p-&gt;lname, p-&gt;from, p-&gt;to);
  fflush(stdout);
  pthread_mutex_unlock(p-&gt;es-&gt;lock);
          
  wait_for_elevator(p);
  get_on_elevator(p);
  wait_to_get_off_elevator(p);
  get_off_elevator(p);
  person_done(p);

  pthread_mutex_lock(p-&gt;es-&gt;lock);
  printf("%8.3lf: %s %s is done.\n", finesleep_time(FINESLEEPER), p-&gt;fname, p-&gt;lname);
  fflush(stdout);
  p-&gt;es-&gt;npeople_finished++;
  pthread_mutex_unlock(p-&gt;es-&gt;lock);

  pthread_mutex_destroy(p-&gt;lock);
  free(p-&gt;lock);
  pthread_cond_destroy(p-&gt;cond);
  free(p-&gt;cond);
  free(p);
  return NULL;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The basic activities of a person are in the middle five lines.  A person first calls
<b>wait_for_elevator()</b>, which you will define.  This should block until an 
elevator is on the person's <b>from</b> floor, with the door open (and blocked
on its condition variable).  At that time,
the person's <b>e</b> field will be set to the appropriate elevator.  The person
calls <b>get_on_elevator()</b>, which is defined in <b>elevator_skeleton.c</b>,
which puts him/her on the elevator's Dllist.  
<p>
Next, the person calls <b>wait_to_get_off_elevator</b>, which you write.  This will
block until the elevator has legally moved to the person's destination floor and
opened the door (and is blocked on the elevator's condition variable).  At this point,
the person calls <b>get_off_elevator()</b>, which is defined in <b>elevator_skeleton.c</b>,
to take the person off the elevator's Dllist.  Finally, the person calls
<b>person_done()</b>, which allows you to perform any final activties on the person.
<p>
The procedures <b>get_on_elevator()</b> and <b>get_off_elevator()</b> are all
straightforward, putting people on elevators' lists and taking them off.  They
also print out what is happening.
<p>
Finally, <b>open_door()</b>, <b>close_door()</b>, and <b>move_to_floor</b> 
are three more procedures defined in <b>elevator_skeleton.c</b>.  They simulate
the elevators' basic activities by calling <b>finesleep_sleep()</b> for the 
appropriate amount of time, printing out
information, and updating the relevant parts of the elevators' data.  
<p>
<hr>
<h3>What you are to write</h3>

You are going to write two solutions to this.  The first will be a simple solution
like the one above, where each elevator serves each person in order.  Your second
solution should be more creative.  Each solution must implement the following 
seven procedures, defined above:
<p>
<UL>
<LI><b> void initialize_simulation(Elevator_Simulation *es)</b>
<LI><b> void initialize_elevator(Elevator *e)</b>
<LI><b> void initialize_person(Person *p)</b>
<LI><b> void wait_for_elevator(Person *p)</b>
<LI><b> void wait_to_get_off_elevator(Person *p)</b>
<LI><b> void person_done(Person *p)</b>
<LI><b> void *elevator(void *arg)</b>
</UL>
<p>

Your <b>elevator</b>'s should call <b>open_door()</b>, <b>close_door()</b>
from <b>move_to_floor()</b> appropriately.  All sleeping and printing should
be done in <b>elevator_skeleton.c</b>.  Thus, your final program that you hand
in should not do any sleeping or any printing.  
<p>

<hr>
<h3>elevator_null.c</h3>

This is a null solution that compiles, but doesn't do anything in the procedures.
It exits in <b>get_on_elevator()</b> because <b>wait_for_elevator()</b> doesn't
set the person's <b>e</b> field:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>elevator_null 5 1 5 1 1 20 0</b>
   0.937: Sofia Riley(0) arrives at floor 01 wanting to go to floor 04.
Error at time 0.937: Sofia Riley(0) called get_on_elevator with a NULL elevator.
UNIX> <b></b>
</pre>

<hr>
<h3>elevator_part_1.c</h3>

Your first solution should work like <b>elevator_part_1</b> above.  Each person,
when he/she calls <b>wait_for_elevator()</b> should be appended to a global 
list and block.  Each elevator simply removes the first person from the list
and services just that person, ignoring all others.  It's a bad solution, but
it is good practice.  

To help you, here are the basic steps of each procedure.

<UL>
<LI><b> void initialize_simulation(Elevator_Simulation *es)</b>: Set up the global
list and a condition variable for blocking elevators.
<LI><b> void initialize_elevator(Elevator *e)</b>: Not used.
<LI><b> void initialize_person(Person *p)</b>:Not used.
<LI><b> void wait_for_elevator(Person *p)</b>: Append the person to the global list.
Signal the condition variable for blocking elevators.  Block on the person's condition variable.
<LI><b> void wait_to_get_off_elevator(Person *p)</b>: Unblock the elevator's 
condition variable and block on the person's condition variable.
<LI><b> void person_done(Person *p)</b>: Unblock the elevator's condition variable.
<LI><b> void *elevator(void *arg)</b>: Each elevator is a while loop.  Check the
global list and if it's empty, block on the condition variable for blocking elevators.
When the elevator gets a person to service, it moves to the appropriate floor and
opens its door.  It puts itself into the person's <b>e</b> field, 
then signals the person and blocks until the person wakes it up.  When it wakes
up, it goes to the person's destination floor, opens its door, signals the person
and blocks.  When the person wakes it up, it closes its door and re-executes its
while loop.
</UL>
<p>

While your solution's output doesn't have to match mine exactly, it should be
pretty close.  In fact, it really should match mine unless you call it with 
very short times, and you may get into nondeterminism.  
<p>
Here are some example output files with <b>elevator_part_1</b>.  Note, the ones
with tiny times can be nondeterministic, so if you run them, the results may differ
slightly.

</UL>
<hr>
<h3>Part 2 -- Do Better</h3>

Your second part is to implement a better solution.  I have implemented one that is 
kind of better in 
<b>elevator_part_2</b>.  It is boneheadedly simple.  Each elevator simply moves floor by 
floor from floor one to the top and back again.  When it reaches a floor, it checks to
see if there are any people waiting on that floor and going in the proper direction.
If so, it opens its door and lets all such people on.  Obviously, it lets them off
too.  The synchronization here is a little trickier, because the elevator has to wait
for all people to get on and off before closing its door.    It also makes sure that
if one elevator is opening its door to let people on, another elevator doesn't do
the same.  Interestingly, I found that the best data structures were "buttons" on 
each floor, just like a real building.
<p>
There are eight test scenarios that we will use to rate your <b>part 2</b> solution.
It must perform at least as well as my <b>elevator_part_2</b> 
in each of the eight cases.  I'll describe how to score the solutions below.
<p>
You should submit your two C files and a text file describing how your part 2 works.

<h3>Scoring a Solution</h3>

To score a solution, I will run one setting of the parameters with ten consecutive seeds.
Each run will result in a percentage: percentage of people finished of those who started.
We will average those percentages for ten different seeds and that will give you a score
for those parameters.  The following table summarizes the eight test scenarios and how
my programs ran on them with a starting seed of 0.  
This is on the lab machines, which die if there are more than 
350 or so threads at any one times.  
<p>
I use the shell script in <b>run_and_time.sh</b>.  If you run it, make sure that you
copy the file <a href=runs.txt</b>runs.txt</b></a>.  Example:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>sh run_and_time.sh</b>

Again, your <b>part_2</b> has to score as well as (within a percentage point)

be zero.
