<h1>Select()</h1>

<b>Select()</b> is a system call that lets you probe the
operating system to discern whether or not there
is I/O to be done on various file descriptors. 

<p>For example, suppose that we want to write
<b>jtelnet</b>. This is a program that works just
like "<b>telnet</b>" (for the most part).  
The user specifies a hostname and a port,
and <b>jtelnet</b> performs a <b>request_connection()</b> to that
hostname and port. 

<p>Once the connection is made, <b>jtelnet</b> will take any
bytes that come from the socket connection and
print them out on standard output, and it will
take any input from standard input, and write it
onto the socket connection. 

<p><b>Jtelnet</b> needs <b>select()</b> because it needs to probe
the operating system to discern whether there are
bytes to be read from <b>stdin</b> or from the socket
connection. 

<p>The arguments to <b>select()</b> are as follows:

<pre>
int select (int width, fd_set *readfds, 
                       fd_set *writefds, 
                       fd_set *exceptfds, struct timeval *timeout)
</pre>

The data types <b>fd_set</b> and <b>struct timeval</b> are
defined in 
<a href=file:/usr/include/sys/types.h><b>sys/types.h</b></a>
and 
<a href=file:/usr/include/sys/time.h><b>sys/time.h</b></a>.
In this class, we won't care about selecting for
writable fd's or for exceptional conditions, so
we will always use <b>select()</b> as follows:

<pre>
select(width, readfds, NULL, NULL, NULL);
</pre>

<b>Readfds</b> is a bitmap of file descriptors.  <b>Select()</b>
will return when any of the file descriptors in
the bitmap has something to read.  When it
returns, <b>readfds</b> will be a new bitmap containing
all the file descriptors that have something
read.  In other words, a <b>read()</b> call on that file
descriptor is guaranteed not to block.  It may
return with a value of zero (i.e. end of file),
but it is guaranteed to return. 

<p>We manipulate the bitmaps with the macros:

<pre>
     FD_SET (fd, &fdset)
     FD_CLR (fd, &fdset)
     FD_ISSET (fd, &fdset)
     FD_ZERO (&fdset)
</pre>

where <b>fd</b> is an <b>int</b> and <b>fdset</b> is a <b>fd_se</b>t.  
So, to make a bitmap that has file descriptors 0 and
3 set, we would do: 

<pre>
  fd_set fds;

  FD_ZERO(&fds);
  FD_SET(0, &fds);
  FD_SET(3, &fds);
</pre>

We use <b>FD_CLR()</b> to clear bits from the
bitmap, and <b>FD_ISSET()</b> to test to see if a
particular bit is set.  

<p>Now, jtelnet (in 
<a href=jtelnet.c><b>jtelnet.c</b></a>):

<p>First, we mess with <b>argc</b> and <b>argv</b> and do the 
requisite <b>request_connection</b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include "sockettome.h"
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;

main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  int port;
  int fd;
  char *hostname, buf[100];
  fd_set readfds, masterfds;                            
  int nopen, n;

  if (argc != 3) {
    fprintf(stderr, "usage: jtelnet host port\n");
    exit(1);
  }

  hostname = argv[1];
  port = atoi(argv[2]);

  fd = request_connection(hostname, port);
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Now, we are going to use two <b>fd_set</b>s 
-- a permanent one called <b>masterfds</b>, and
a temporary one called <b>readfds</b>.  First, we initialize 
<b>masterfds</b> so that fd zero and the socket connection are set:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><pre>
  FD_ZERO(&masterfds);
  FD_SET(0, &masterfds);
  FD_SET(fd, &masterfds);
</pre></td></table></center><p>
  
Now, we go through an infinite loop that first
copies <b>masterfds</b> to <b>readfds</b>, then calls <b>select()</b>
on <b>readfds</b>, and then performs the correct action
(sending <b>stdin</b> to the socket, or input from the
socket to <b>stdout</b>) depending on what bits of
<b>readfds</b> <b>select()</b> sets.  An <b>EOF</b> from
either <b>stdin</b> or from the socket ends the telnet
session.  

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><pre>
  while (1) {
    memcpy(&readfds, &masterfds, sizeof(fd_set));

    if (select(fd+1, &readfds, NULL, NULL, NULL) < 0) {
      perror("on select");
      exit(1);
    }

    if (FD_ISSET(0, &readfds)) {
      n = read(0, buf, 100);
      if (n == 0) {
        close(0);
        close(fd);
        exit(1);
      } else {
        write(fd, buf, n);
      }
    } 

    if (FD_ISSET(fd, &readfds)) {
      n = read(fd, buf, 100);
      if (n == 0) {
        close(0);
        close(fd);
        exit(1);
      } else {
        write(1, buf, n);
      }
    }

  }
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<p><b>Telnet</b> is a nice program because it is a generalized client.  
Back in the days before the web and massive security concerns, people
wrote servers to which clients would telnet.  For example, as of the
most recent revision of these lecture notes (April, 2010), there is a
weather server 
at host <b>rainmaker.wunderground.com</b> and port 
3000.  If you 
<b>telnet</b> to it (or <b>jtelnet</b>), you can get current weather conditions.
This is a very powerful paradigm.  <b>Telnet</b> is nice because it allows
the people at Michigan to set up a server without providing client 
code -- we already have the client: <b>telnet</b>.  
<p>
Of course, now we have the web, which is made possible by protocols to write
general graphical clients with hypertext.  That's a little beyond the scope of
this lecture....
