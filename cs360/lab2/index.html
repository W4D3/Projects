<h3>data_uncompress.c - using the C standard I/O library</h3>

Your job is to write the program <b>data_uncompress</b>, using the C standard I/O library.
In particular, you should read using <b>getchar()</b> and <b>fread()</b>.
<p>
This program assumes that standard input is in a compressed format.  The format is a stream of 
bytes as follows.  You read a character, and that character tells you how to proceed:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>  If the character is not 'n', 's', 'i' or 'd', then the input is not correct.  
<LI>  If the character is 'n', then print a newline.
<LI>  If the character is 'i', 'd' or 's', then the next character needs to be interpreted as an integer
(unsigned char).
Call this integer <b>n</b>.  Then you are going to read
<b>n+1</b> contiguous integers, doubles or strings, depending on whether the initial character 
was 'i', 'd' or 's'.  Integers are 4 bytes and doubles are 8 bytes.  Strings are in a special 
format.  You read a character <b>size</b> which you interpret as an integer (again -- unsigned char).  
The string is in the remaining <b>size+1</b> characters.
Obviously, since <b>size</b> and <b>n</b> are unsigned chars, their values will be limited to 255 or
less.
<p>
You are going to print each integer, double or string on the same line, separated by a single space.
You only print a newline when you see the 'n'.  
Do not start a new line with a space. 
Simply print integers with "%d".  Print doubles
with "%.10lg".
Continue reading in this vein until you reach EOF.  You 
only print a newline when you see the 'n' character.
</UL>

Here's an example file in <b>comp-1.txt</b> -- each cell of the table is a character of the file:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3>
<tr>
<td>115 ('s')</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>74 ('J')</td>
<td>105 ('i')</td>
<td>109 ('m')</td>
<td>4 </td>
<td>80 ('P')</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>108 ('l')</td>
<td>97 ('a')</td>
<td>110 ('n')</td>
<td>107 ('k')</td>
<td>110 ('n')</td>
<td>115 ('s')</td>
<td>0 </td>
<td>4 </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>67 ('C')</td>
<td>83 ('S')</td>
<td>51 ('3')</td>
<td>54 ('6')</td>
<td>48 ('0')</td>
<td>110 ('n')</td></tr>
</table></center><p></td>

When you uncompress this, you first see the 's', and then a one.  That means you need to read two strings.
The first consists of three characters, which are 'J', 'i' and 'm', and the second consists of five 
characters  - "Plank".  You print "Jim", a space and "Plank."  Then you read a 'n', and print a newline.
Next you read a 's' and the number 0, which means to read one string.  That string has five characters:
"CS360".  You print "CS360", then read the final 'n' and print a newline.  
<p>
Thus:
<p>
<pre>
UNIX> <b>data_uncompress < comp-1.txt</b>
Jim Plank
CS360
UNIX> <b></b>
</pre>
<p>

I have written a program called <b>data_compress</b>, which turns standard input into the proper 
format to be read by <b>data_uncompress</b>.  It turns most numbers into integers and doubles, and
the rest of its words into strings.
For example, if we do:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>echo "1234 3.14159 Fred" | data_compress > comp-2.txt</b>
</pre>

Then <b>comp-2.txt</b> is composed of the following bytes:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3>
<tr>
<td>105('i')</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>210</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>100('d')</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>134</td>
<td>27</td>
<td>240</td>
<td>249</td>
<td>33</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>64</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>115('s')</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>70('F')</td>
<td>114('r')</td>
<td>101('e')</td>
<td>100('d')</td>
<td>110('n')</td>
</tr>
</table></center><p>

To uncompress, you first read the 'i' and the 0, which says to read one integer.  You will read the next
four bytes (210, 4, 0, 0) using <b>fread()</b>.  
You next read the byte 'd' and a 0, which say to read one double.
You  will thus read the next eight bytes (110, 134,27, 40, 249, 33, 9, 64) again using <b>fread()</b>.  
Next you read an 's' and 0, which says to read one string.  You read 3, which says that the string is
four characters (Fred).  After reading those, you read the 'n' which says to print a newline.  
<p>
The output is thus:
<pre>
UNIX> <b>data_uncompress < comp-2.txt</b>
1234 3.14159 Fred
UNIX> <b></b>
</pre>

If you call <b>data_compress</b> on a file and pipe the output to <b>data_uncompress</b> or
<b>data_uncompress</b>, you will get a file that is roughly equivalent to the original.
There may be some formatting that is different.  Your output must match mine exactly, however.
<p>
<h3>A Common Mistake</h3>

When you read <i>n</i> and <i>size</i>, you read them as unsigned chars.  However, when you
use them in your computer program, you should convert them to ints.  Why?  Because if you read
in 255 as an unsigned char, and then add one to it, it becomes zero, and that is not what
you want, is it?

<h3>
Error catching</h3>

Your program must catch the following errors, and then print the given strings on standard error:

<UL>
<LI> If the <i>type</i> character is not 'n', 's', 'i' or 'd', then print <b>"Input error: bad type\n"</b>
<LI> If you don't get the size byte <b>n</b>, print <b>"Input error: no size\n"</b>
<LI> If you don't get the string size byte <b>size</b>, print <b>"Input error: no string size\n"</b>
<LI> If you don't get enough ints, print <b>"Input error: not enough ints\n"</b>
<LI> If you don't get enough doubles, print <b>"Input error: not enough doubles\n"</b>
<LI> If you don't get enough characters in a string, print <b>"Input error: not enough chars\n"</b>
</UL>
