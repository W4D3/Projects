GAs He slays them All!
The marching of the Warriors into the Battlefield
WWhen I stalk the Giant's lair, I vent my Hammer's Rage
Oh Anger Anger Is My Middle Name
BLIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
Across the Frozen tundra
+Are You prepared to die
prepare for ATTACK!
9My Nostrils Flare With Steam
There's Lightning In My Eyes
/I feel My Termper Swell
Hear the cries of Glory
1Into the frozen wasteland
Hear the tunes of Glory
OOh Anger Anger Is My Middle Name
Bequeathed to me by Odin, Molded by the Dwarfs
aI split his twisted skull in two and set his corpse ablaze
Can You Hear, Can You Hear The Thunder
-Rising in the east
The Call Of The Triumphant
RThe sound Of Steel On Steel
Give me a weapon of power, which no one else may hold,
