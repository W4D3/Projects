3Across the Frozen tundra
The Time of THOR is coming
3The sound Of Steel On Steel
I feel My Termper Swell
>Can You Hear, Can You Hear The Thunder
Hear the tunes of Glory
=LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
prepare for ATTACK!
LAs He slays them All!
Defend the Gods with honor, To lead the BRAVE and BOLD
&Rising in the east
One Man stands tall
4Are You prepared to die
There's Lightning In My Eyes
5Into the frozen wasteland
The Mighty Sound Of Thunder
[I split his twisted skull in two and set his corpse ablaze
Oh Anger Anger Is My Middle Name
0Hear the cries of Glory
See The Chariots Blazing
JFire Pumps My Veins
When I stalk the Giant's lair, I vent my Hammer's Rage
