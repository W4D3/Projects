Give me a weapon of power, which no one else may hold,
Defend the Gods with honor, To lead the BRAVE and BOLD
Bequeathed to me by Odin, Molded by the Dwarfs
MINE! This shimmering mallet, The Symbol of the Norse
LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
When I stalk the Giant's lair, I vent my Hammer's Rage
I split his twisted skull in two and set his corpse ablaze
See The Chariots Blazing
Across the Northern Sky
Hear the tunes of Glory
Are You prepared to die
The Mighty Sound Of Thunder
The steel across your Back
The Time of THOR is coming
prepare for ATTACK!
The Call Of The Triumphant
The sound Of Steel On Steel
The marching of the Warriors into the Battlefield
Across the Frozen tundra
Across the seven seas
Can You Hear, Can You Hear The Thunder
Rising in the east
Into the frozen wasteland
One Man stands tall
Hear the cries of Glory
As He slays them All!
Stripped Of Any Freedom
Locked Up In These Chains
I feel My Termper Swell
Fire Pumps My Veins
Oh Anger Anger Is My Middle Name
Oh Anger Anger Is My Middle Name
My Nostrils Flare With Steam
I hear The Battle Cry
There's A Fury In My Heart
There's Lightning In My Eyes
