4There's A Fury In My Heart
Locked Up In These Chains
/Hear the tunes of Glory
Are You prepared to die
EThe Mighty Sound Of Thunder
LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
IThe steel across your Back
Bequeathed to me by Odin, Molded by the Dwarfs
VOh Anger Anger Is My Middle Name
MINE! This shimmering mallet, The Symbol of the Norse
5There's Lightning In My Eyes
Across the Frozen tundra
RThe sound Of Steel On Steel
When I stalk the Giant's lair, I vent my Hammer's Rage
LDefend the Gods with honor, To lead the BRAVE and BOLD
As He slays them All!
NGive me a weapon of power, which no one else may hold,
I feel My Termper Swell
7The Time of THOR is coming
My Nostrils Flare With Steam
0Across the Northern Sky
See The Chariots Blazing
