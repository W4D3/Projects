.The Call Of The Triumphant
One Man stands tall
RThe Mighty Sound Of Thunder
Give me a weapon of power, which no one else may hold,
&prepare for ATTACK!
Rising in the east
2Across the Northern Sky
The steel across your Back
?I hear The Battle Cry
LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
WWhen I stalk the Giant's lair, I vent my Hammer's Rage
Oh Anger Anger Is My Middle Name
,Fire Pumps My Veins
See The Chariots Blazing
0The Time of THOR is coming
As He slays them All!
lI split his twisted skull in two and set his corpse ablaze
The marching of the Warriors into the Battlefield
HBequeathed to me by Odin, Molded by the Dwarfs
Into the frozen wasteland
4There's Lightning In My Eyes
Are You prepared to die
