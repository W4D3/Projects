8Oh Anger Anger Is My Middle Name
Are You prepared to die
6The sound Of Steel On Steel
There's A Fury In My Heart
NHear the cries of Glory
Defend the Gods with honor, To lead the BRAVE and BOLD
=One Man stands tall
LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
5See The Chariots Blazing
There's Lightning In My Eyes
.Fire Pumps My Veins
The Time of THOR is coming
4The Call Of The Triumphant
Into the frozen wasteland
hGive me a weapon of power, which no one else may hold,
The marching of the Warriors into the Battlefield
4The Mighty Sound Of Thunder
Across the Frozen tundra
+prepare for ATTACK!
Across the Northern Sky
TI split his twisted skull in two and set his corpse ablaze
Locked Up In These Chains
