3Across the Frozen tundra
The Call Of The Triumphant
6My Nostrils Flare With Steam
Locked Up In These Chains
ALIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
I feel My Termper Swell
MMINE! This shimmering mallet, The Symbol of the Norse
Are You prepared to die
?See The Chariots Blazing
Can You Hear, Can You Hear The Thunder
4Fire Pumps My Veins
Oh Anger Anger Is My Middle Name
7The steel across your Back
There's Lightning In My Eyes
DRising in the east
The marching of the Warriors into the Battlefield
)One Man stands tall
As He slays them All!
WOh Anger Anger Is My Middle Name
Give me a weapon of power, which no one else may hold,
JThe Mighty Sound Of Thunder
Bequeathed to me by Odin, Molded by the Dwarfs
