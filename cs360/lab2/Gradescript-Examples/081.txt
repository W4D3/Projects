HBequeathed to me by Odin, Molded by the Dwarfs
Locked Up In These Chains
/The sound Of Steel On Steel
Fire Pumps My Veins
0Hear the cries of Glory
See The Chariots Blazing
[The marching of the Warriors into the Battlefield
LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
7The Call Of The Triumphant
My Nostrils Flare With Steam
QGive me a weapon of power, which no one else may hold,
The steel across your Back
8Oh Anger Anger Is My Middle Name
Across the Northern Sky
LI hear The Battle Cry
Defend the Gods with honor, To lead the BRAVE and BOLD
aCan You Hear, Can You Hear The Thunder
I split his twisted skull in two and set his corpse ablaze
1Across the seven seas
The Mighty Sound Of Thunder
1Into the frozen wasteland
I feel My Termper Swell
