MI split his twisted skull in two and set his corpse ablaze
Rising in the east
PWhen I stalk the Giant's lair, I vent my Hammer's Rage
Into the frozen wasteland
LAs He slays them All!
Defend the Gods with honor, To lead the BRAVE and BOLD
WOh Anger Anger Is My Middle Name
Give me a weapon of power, which no one else may hold,
ALIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
Across the Northern Sky
-I hear The Battle Cry
Hear the tunes of Glory
OMINE! This shimmering mallet, The Symbol of the Norse
Locked Up In These Chains
0My Nostrils Flare With Steam
prepare for ATTACK!
-Hear the cries of Glory
Across the seven seas
=Oh Anger Anger Is My Middle Name
There's Lightning In My Eyes
AThe Call Of The Triumphant
Can You Hear, Can You Hear The Thunder
