1Into the frozen wasteland
I feel My Termper Swell
+Across the Northern Sky
Fire Pumps My Veins
.See The Chariots Blazing
I hear The Battle Cry
ROh Anger Anger Is My Middle Name
The marching of the Warriors into the Battlefield
=LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
One Man stands tall
ARising in the east
Bequeathed to me by Odin, Molded by the Dwarfs
6The Mighty Sound Of Thunder
The Time of THOR is coming
1Hear the cries of Glory
Locked Up In These Chains
QThe sound Of Steel On Steel
MINE! This shimmering mallet, The Symbol of the Norse
QThe Call Of The Triumphant
When I stalk the Giant's lair, I vent my Hammer's Rage
4Are You prepared to die
There's Lightning In My Eyes
