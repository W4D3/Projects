	The problem we had to solve was sorting the contents of a text file by the hostnames of the machines in each line. The lines of the file were all formated in the same way so the reading and writing of the characters, newlines, and whitespace was easily done with pythons regular expression module. I used the sys library to read the file from standard input, and after reading each line it would stop and analyze each line. Each line had indicators for what colors had to be printed out so I used the search method for pythons re to parse the lines. I then printed out each line in its proper color. The coloring format is standard ANSI.
	I started by first reading the whole file line by line and printing it out to standard output. Then I went color by color coding in conditional statments. I ran into a few bugs when it came to understanding how to string together expressions to search a string for certain keywords. I had a problem not searching for the mgmt string for yellow colors which was solved by using the ^ symbol and then mgmt. This ^mgmt symbol would complement the string and search for all lines that didn't have mgmt in it so that I could differentiate green and yellow machines. I also had trouble printing out the cyan lines that had web in the hostname. I emailed the TA and we solved this issue by switching the lists of words for green, yellow, and cyan lines from [web, db, ...] to (web|db|...) and that solved a bunch of issues with output errors. However, it would work in standard set notion for yellow either way or with the re expression (word|word|...) syntax.
	Overall it was a fun assignment and I enjoyed how quickly I was able to complete it.
