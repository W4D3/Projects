At the end of the first game he gives a subtle hint
saying that he should have preformed a certain swap
earlier. Maybe we should use a vector and store the
connected pieces in there and when the number of
empty spaces gets scarily low then swap and score a 
goal

- Is it better to swap and score asap or to let a
big number of pieces collect before scoring?
