As with lab 3, this is a long writeup, and there are a lot of moving parts. 
I'm giving this to you for three reasons.  The first is to reinforce enumeration, yet again.
The second is to give you practice in making use of third-party tools (the Galois Field
library, and the Incremental Inverse library).  You'll be doing that a lot in your
career, so practice is important.   The third is to get practice doing things that are
foreign to you.  I'm sure the MIDI lab did that too. Being an effective programmer means
understanding your problem space well enough to write useful programs, perhaps without
understanding a lot of the underlying details, because as long as your tools work as they should,
you don't <i>need</i> to understand the underlying details.

<hr>
<i>Just a caveat here.  Although this story may be influenced by real-life events,
I've made up a bunch of the details and distorted the personalities to make
the story more amusing.  So, "Luigi" or "Slim," if you read this, please don't take
offense at my distortion of your personalities...</i>

<h2>Welcome to the world of my research</h2>

Here's the back story.  
Every year, you travel to California to attend the biggest annual conference on
storage, <I>SLOW: Storage Lovers Of the World</i>.  
This year, you travel to SLOW, and while you are there, you stop by
the giant computer company JCN to have lunch with your colleagues Luigi and Slim.
They are giddy with excitement, because they've
developed a new erasure coding paradigm, plus erasure codes to go with it.  
For now, pretend that you're me and
you know what that means.  They've applied for the patent and written up a
60+ page, math-laden report on it, which they've asked you to read.  You do and agree -- 
it's a really cool paradigm, and you're looking forward to them writing it
up for next year's SLOW.
<p>
An awkward silence ensues, after which Luigi professes that he cannot 
envision improving the 60 page report in any way.  He's a theoretician, and 
those 60 pages are necessary for precision and completeness.  
So, you turn to Slim -- he's a systems guy and could easily write this paper.
No, Slim's got other things to do for JCN, and since the patent's done, and
the codes are going into JCN's production systems, he's not really motivated to
write the paper.  
<p>
As you finish off your Caesar salad, you realize that if this paradigm is going
to make it to SLOW, it's going to be your job.  And that's fine with Luigi
and Slim.  They'll be happy to help in any way.  So when you return to Tennessee,
you start to work on this new paradigm.

<h2>Erasure Codes</h2>

Erasure codes prevent data loss in storage systems.  For the purposes of this work,
your storage system is composed of <i>n</i> disks, each of which holds exactly <i>r</i>
"words".  A word is composed of <i>w</i> bits, and the only values of <i>w</i> about which
we care are 8, 16 and 32.  Let's draw a storage system below:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=System.jpg></td></table></center><p>

In this system, <i>n = 6</i> and <i>r = 4</i>.  We have labeled the disks 
<i>D<sub>0</sub></i>
through
<i>D<sub>5</sub></i>.
There are <i>nr</i> words in the 
system, and we label each word <i>b<sub>i,j</sub></i>, where <i>j</i> is the 
number of the disk that holds the word (<i>D<sub>j</sub></i>), 
and <i>i</i> is the "row" of the word on the disk.
<p>
The problem with disk systems is that they break, and they break in two different
ways.  Sometimes the entire disk breaks, which means that all of the data on it 
is lost.  We will call that an "operational failure."  More frequently, though, individual
words are lost.  These are called "sector failures."  
<p>
To protect against failures, you use an <i>erasure code</i>.  With an erasure code, you
partition the <i>nr</i> words into "data" and "coding".  The data words store data.
The coding words are calculated from the data.  However, the coding words are calculated
in such a way that when operational and sector failures occur to data words, you can
use the non-failed data and coding words to recalculate them.  In that way, you don't 
lose data!
<p>
Let's call Luigi and Slim's code "LS" codes.  After reading the 60 page report, you 
believe that they work as follows.  You choose two new parameters, <i>m</i> and <i>s</i>.
You are going to dedicate all of the words on <i>m</i> disks to coding.  Of the remaining
<i>r(n-m)</i> words, you are also going to dedicate <i>s</i> of them to coding.  In the
picture above, <i>m = 2</i> and <i>s = 2</i>.  The codes are designed so that <i>any</i>
combination of <i>m</i> operational failures and <i>s</i> sector failures can be tolerated.
<p>
So you write some tools to help you explore the LS codes, and when you try to 
match your tools to the theorems in the 60 page report, you find a problem.  Either your
tools are broken, or the theorems are wrong.  You double-check this, then triple-check it,
because you know that Luigi is a brilliant theoretician, and it's highly unlikely that
his theorems are wrong.  But you're a stellar programmer, and you've verified 
that your tools are correct
using every means possible.
So you email Luigi, presenting him with a case
where the tools don't match the math.  
<p>
Luigi responds that both the tools and the math are correct.  Phew!  What's incorrect is your
understanding of the LS codes.  Their failure model is richer than the one you've described
above.  The failure model takes a paragraph to explain, so I'm not going to bother, but
the nice thing is that your failure model is new, and while you can use LS codes to fit your
failure model, there are many cases where there are no LS codes for you to use.  This is 
awesome, because it gives you great research to put into your SLOW paper.
<p>
Ok, time to get to work, and I'm sure you're tired of reading all this chatty prose and want
to get on with this lab, so here it is.  You want your codes to have what we'll call
the "JLS" property.  That is, that the codes can tolerate the failure of any <i>m</i> 
disks and any additional <i>s</i> words.  You are going to write a program called
<b>is_jls.cpp</b>.  That program is going to take as command line arguments the parameters
of the erasure code.  I'll specify that more precisely below.   Then, your program 
is going to enumerate all of the failure scenarios -- it will enumerate all failures of <i>m</i> 
disks, plus all additional failures of <i>s</i> words.  That is a two-part enumeration.
For each set of failures, it will double-check that the erasure code can tolerate the
failures.  If it tolerates all the combinations that you have enumerated, then the 
program prints <b>OK</b>.  If it discovers
a set of failures that the code cannot tolerate, then it prints <b>No:</b>, and then specifies
the failures. 
<p>
<hr>
<h3>Erasure codes expressed as Parity Check Matrices</h3>

For the purposes of our lab, an erasure code is specified by 
a "Parity Check Matrix," which is a matrix with <i>mr+s</i> rows and
<i>nr</i> columns.  Each row represents an equation and each column represents a word in
the disk system.  Specifically, word <i>b<sub>i,j</sub></i> is in column <i>ni+j</i>.
Now, when <i>m</i> disks and <i>s</i> words fail, we create a testing matrix from the
<i>mr+s</i> columns of the Parity Check Matrix that correspond to the failed words.
You'll note, this testing matrix is a square matrix because it has <i>mr+s</i> rows and
<i>mr+s</i> columns.  If this matrix is invertible, then we can recalculate the failed
words from the surviving words.  If this matrix is not invertible, then we cannot.
<p>
Here's an example.  Below is a Parity Check Matrix for our example system where <i>n = 6</i>,
<i>m = 2</i>, <i>s = 2</i> and <i>r = 4</i>.  I've labeled how each column represents one
word of the system.  I've colored columns that represent data words blue, and columns that 
represent coding words pink.  
<p><center><table border=0><td><img src=PCM.jpg></td></table></center><p>

Suppose we have operational failures of disks <i>D<sub>0</sub></i>
and <i>D<sub>4</sub></i>, plus sector failures on words 
<i>b<sub>0,3</sub></i> and
<i>b<sub>2,5</sub></i>.  To see if we can decode, we create the following 
testing matrix from the columns that represent the failed words:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src=Tester.jpg></td></table></center><p>

And we test to see if this matrix is invertible.  As it turns out, it is not invertible, so 
the code represented by that Parity Check Matrix is not a JLS code.

<hr>
<h3>Final Pieces of the Puzzle: Galois Fields, Specifying Codes and Matrix Inversion</h3>

Every element of our system is a <i>w</i>-bit word, and therefore can be represented by a
 number between 0 and (2<sup><i>w</i></sup>-1).  Because we are using matrices, we need to 
employ addition and multiplication.  However, since we are using a fixed set of numbers,
our addition and multiplication have to work over this fixed set of numbers.  
The addition and multiplication that we will use is called "Galois Field" arithmetic.
It is denoted <i>GF(2<sup>w</sup>)</i>.  You don't have to worry about how it works -- you 
just have to trust that it does work.  And it does.  
<p>
Addition in <i>GF(2<sup>w</sup>)</i> is equal to bitwise exclusive-or.  Thus, for example, 2+3 = 1,
and 2+2 = 0.  Moreover, you don't really need to care about addition because you won't have to 
do any addition in this lab.  Multiplication is more difficult, and I have written a small library
that does multiplication for you.  It defines a class called <b>Galois_Field</b> with the
following definition (in 
<b><a href=galois_field.h>galois_field.h</a></b> and
<b><a href=galois_field.cpp>galois_field.cpp</a></b>):

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

typedef vector &lt;unsigned int&gt; UIVec;
class Galois_Field {
  public:
    Galois_Field(int w);
    unsigned int Multiply(unsigned int a, unsigned int b);
    unsigned int Divide(unsigned int a, unsigned int b);
    unsigned int Inverse(unsigned int a);
  protected:
    int W;
    vector &lt;unsigned char&gt; Mult_Table_8;
    vector &lt;unsigned char&gt; Div_Table_8;
    vector &lt;unsigned short&gt; Log_Table_16;
    vector &lt;unsigned short&gt; ILog_Table_16;
    vector &lt;UIVec&gt; Tables_32;
};

</pre></td></table></center><p>

It's pretty simple to use -- you construct an instance of it with the constructor, where
you specify the value of <i>w</i> that you wish to use.  Only 8, 16 and 32 are supported.
You use the methods <b>Multiply()</b> and <b>Divide()</b> to multiply and divide two
numbers, respectively.  In this lab, you only have to use <b>Multiply()</b>. 
<p>
I've written a very small program, <b>galois_mult</b>, 
that multiplies two numbers in <i>GF(2<sup>w</sup>)</i>.
You give it the two numbers and <i>w</i> on the command line.  For example:
<p>
<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_mult 2 3 8</b></font>
6
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_mult 20 20 8</b></font>
13
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_mult 200 2 8</b></font>
141
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_mult 30000 3 16</b></font>
40784
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_mult 100000 100000 32</b></font>
1079264263
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Yes, it's weird that 20 times 20 is equal to 13 in <i>GF(2<sup>8</sup>)</i>.
That Galois dude was pretty smart when he invented this in the early 1800's.
<p>
I've also written <b>galois_divide</b>.  Although you won't use division in this
lab, it's nice to see that multiplication and division have the correct properties
in <i>GF(2<sup>w</sup>)</i>.  For example, see how the divisions below match to
the multiplications above:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_divide 6 3 8</b></font>
2
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_divide 13 20 8</b></font>
20
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_divide 40784 30000 16</b></font>
3
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_divide 40784 3 16</b></font>
30000
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_divide 1079264263 100000 32</b></font>
100000
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Armed with this knowledge, I can now give you the complete specifications for
how to create a parity check matrix.  Along with <i>n, m, s, r</i> and <i>w</i>,
a code is defined by <i>m+s</i> "coding coefficients."  We are going to label
them <i>a<sub>0</sub></i> through 
<i>a<sub>m+s-1</sub></i>.
The first <i>mr</i> rows of the Parity Check matrix are defined as follows:
<p>
Let <i>x</i>  be a number such that 0 <i>&le; x &lt; mr</i>.  
Let <i>i = x % r</i> and <i>k = x / r</i>.  Then all entries in row <i>x</i> are
equal to zero, except for those that correspond to words 
<i>b<sub>i,j</sub></i>, for <i>0 &le; j &lt; n</i>.  The number in that row and column
is equal to <i>(a<sub>k</sub>)<sup>ni+j</sup></i>.  Multiplication here is in <i>GF(2<sup>w</sup>)</i>.
<p>
Take a minute to see how this works for the first eight rows of the Parity Check Matrix pictured above.
This matrix is the code in <i>GF(2<sup>8</sup>)</i> 
where <i>a<sub>0</sub> = 1</i>,  
<i>a<sub>1</sub> = 2</i>,  
<i>a<sub>2</sub> = 4</i>  and 
<i>a<sub>3</sub> = 8</i>.  
Let's see how it matches to the definition.
Suppose, for example, that <i>x = 6</i>.  Then <i>i= (6%4) = 2</i> and <i>k = (6/4) = 1</i>.
Therefore, all entries in row <i>6</i> are zero, except for those that correspond to 
<i>b<sub>2,0</sub></i> through <i>b<sub>2,5</sub></i>.
Those entries should equal <i>(a<sub>1</sub>)<sup>(6)(2)+j</sup></i> for <i>0 &le; j &lt 6</i>.
In other words, those entries should equal 2<sup>12</sup> through 
2<sup>17</sup>  in <i>GF(2<sup>8</sup>)</i>.  Verify that they do with <b>galois_mult</b>.
First, calculate 2<sup>2</sup> = 2*2, then 
2<sup>4</sup> = 2<sup>2</sup>*2<sup>2</sup>, then
2<sup>8</sup> = 2<sup>4</sup>*2<sup>4</sup>, then
2<sup>12</sup> = 2<sup>8</sup>*2<sup>4</sup>:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_mult 2 2 8</b></font>
4
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_mult 4 4 8</b></font>
16
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_mult 16 16 8</b></font>
29
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_mult 29 16 8</b></font>
205
UNIX>
</pre>

That means that 2<sup>12</sup> = 205.  Now calculate 
2<sup>13</sup> through
2<sup>17</sup>:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_mult 205 2 8</b></font>
135
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_mult 135 2 8</b></font>
19
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_mult 19 2 8</b></font>
38
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_mult 38 2 8</b></font>
76
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_mult 76 2 8</b></font>
152
UNIX> 
</pre>

See how that matches row 6 in the Parity Check Matrix?
<p>
Now, the final <i>s</i> rows of the matrix are defined pretty simply.  The element in
row <i>mr+i</i>, column <i>j</i> is equal to <i>(a<sub>m+i</sub>)<sup>j</sup></i>.
Verify it for yourself.  The element in row 9, column 23 is 47.  That should equal
<i>(a<sub>3</sub>)<sup>23</sup></i>= 8<sup>23</sup>.  See if you can follow that calculation
below:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_mult 8 8 8</b></font>     
64                                   This means that 8<sup>2</sup> = 64
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_mult 64 64 8</b></font>
205                                  This means that 8<sup>4</sup> = 205
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_mult 205 205 8</b></font>
143                                  This means that 8<sup>8</sup> = 143
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_mult 143 143 8</b></font>
70                                  This means that 8<sup>16</sup> = 70
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_mult 143 70 8</b></font>
101                                  This means that 8<sup>24</sup> = 101
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>galois_divide 101 8 8</b></font>
47                                   This means that 8<sup>23</sup> = 47
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Now that you know how to create a parity check matrix, you need to know how to test whether
a matrix is invertible.  To help you with that, I have implemented a second library, defined
in 
<b><a href=incremental_inverse.h>incremental_inverse.h</a></b> and
<b><a href=incremental_inverse.cpp>incremental_inverse.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include "galois_field.h"

class Incremental_Inverse {
  public:
    Incremental_Inverse(int rows, Galois_Field *gf);
    int Add_Col(vector &lt;unsigned int&gt; &col);
    void Delete_Col();
    void Print();   
  protected:
    Galois_Field *gf;
    vector &lt;UIVec&gt; Cols;
    vector &lt;int&gt; Pivots;
    int Rows;
    int NCols;
};
</pre></td></table></center><p>

This library is nice because it allows you to test for invertibility of a square matrix,
starting with an empty matrix and adding one column of the matrix at a time.  You create
an instance of the class with the constructor, parameterized by the number of rows
that the matrix will have when it is square, and a pointer to the Galois Field.
When you want to add a column to the matrix, you call ,<b>Add_Col</b> with a vector
of elements.  The vector should have <b>rows</b> elements.  <b>Add_Col</b> adds the column
vector to the matrix and tests to see whether its possible that any square matrix with 
the given columns is invertible.  If so, it returns 1.  If not, it returns 0, and does
not add the column to the matrix.    
<p>
This allows you to add columns to the matrix and test for invertibility when you add the
columns.  It allows your enumeration to run faster, because you can add the column when
you define the failure.  You remove the column with <b>Delete_Col</b>.  If you don't 
understand this paragraph, skip it and come back to it later.
<p>
The program <b>ii_test</b> is a program that allows you to get a feeling for 
<b>Incremental_Inverse</b>.  You call it with the number of rows, and <i>w</i> for the
Galois Field.  Then you can add a column with <b>ADD</b> and delete a column with
<b>DELETE</b>.   <b>PRINT</b> is supported, but it's more likely to confuse you, frankly,
than anythine else.
<p>
Let's call it with 4 rows and <i>w</i> equal to eight, and then add an identity matrix
in four <b>ADD</b> calls.  Identity matrices are invertible, so each <b>ADD</b> call
will be successful:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ii_test 4 8</b></font>
II_TEST> <font color=darkred><b>ADD 1 0 0 0</b></font>
Successful
II_TEST> <font color=darkred><b>ADD 0 1 0 0</b></font>
Successful
II_TEST> <font color=darkred><b>ADD 0 0 1 0</b></font>
Successful
II_TEST> <font color=darkred><b>ADD 0 0 0 1</b></font>
Successful
II_TEST> <font color=darkred><b>QUIT</b></font>
UNIX>
</pre>

However, suppose we instead add two duplicate columns.  No matrix with duplicate columns
is invertible, so the <b>ADD</b> will be unsuccessful:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ii_test 4 8</b></font>
II_TEST> <font color=darkred><b>ADD 1 2 3 4</b></font>
Successful
II_TEST> <font color=darkred><b>ADD 1 2 3 4</b></font>
Unsuccessful
II_TEST> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Suppose we add a multiple of the first column -- that also will render the matrix
not invertible:

<pre>
II_TEST> <font color=darkred><b>ADD 2 4 6 8</b></font>
Unsuccessful
II_TEST> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

However, the following matrix is invertible in <i>GF(2<sup>8</sup>)</i>:
<center>
<pre>
1   4   8  11
2   3   9 100
3   2   7  59
4   1   6  38
</pre>
</center>
We add the columns incrementally, and each one is successful:

<pre>
II_TEST> <font color=darkred><b>ADD 4 3 2 1</b></font>
Successful
II_TEST> <font color=darkred><b>ADD 8 9 7 6</b></font>
Successful
II_TEST> <font color=darkred><b>ADD 11 100 59 38</b></font>
Successful
II_TEST> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

We can delete the last column and try to add (8 9 7 6).  That will be unsuccessful, because
the following matrix has duplicate columns, and therefore cannot be invertible.
<center>
<pre>
1   4   8   8
2   3   9   9
3   2   7   7
4   1   6   6
</pre>
</center>

<pre>
II_TEST> <font color=darkred><b>DELETE</b></font>
II_TEST> <font color=darkred><b>ADD 8 9 7 6</b></font>
Unsuccessful
II_TEST> <font color=darkred><b>QUIT</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

<h2>Your program: is_jls.cpp</h2>

Your program <b>is_jls.cpp</b> should accept the following command line parameters in this order:
<i>n, m, s, r, w, a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>m+s-1</sub></i>.
It should create the Parity Check Matrix for these parameters, and then it should enumerate
all combinations of <i>m</i> operational and <i>s</i> sector failures.  Each time it adds
a failure to the enumeration, it should call <b>Add_Col()</b> with the proper column of the
Parity Check Matrix to see if the resulting testing matrix will be invertible.  If it's
not invertible, then the code is not JLS.  Print "No" and a string representing the failures (defined
below).  
If the testing matrix is invertible, then continue the enumeration.
If you enumerate all failure scenarios and the testing matrix
is always invertible, then print "OK" and exit.
<p>
To represent failures in the output, we will use a string with <i>nr</i> characters, one for
each word in the system.  Or, put another way, one for each column of the Parity Check Matrix.
Each character will have one of three values: 
<p>
<UL>
<LI> 'U' if the word is not failed (i.e., it's "up").
<LI> 'D' if the word is on a disk with an operational failure.
<LI> 'S' if the word is down because of a sector failure.
</UL>
<p>
For example, the string for our example Parity Check Matrix and failure scenario is:

<p><center><table border=3><td>DUUSDUDUUUDUDUUUDSDUUUDU</td></table></center><p>
<p>
So, here are some examples:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>is_jls 6 2 2 4 8 1 2 4 8</b></font>
No: DUUSDUDUUUDUDUUUDSDUUUDU
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>is_jls 6 2 2 4 16 1 2 4 8</b></font>
OK
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>is_jls 6 1 2 4 8 1 2 4 </b></font>
OK
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>is_jls 6 1 2 4 8 1 1 1</b></font>
No: DSUUUUDUUUUUDUUUUUDUUUUU
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>is_jls 6 2 2 4 8 1 1 1 1</b></font>
No: DDUUUUDUUUUUDUUUUUDUUUUU
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

The last two calls are always going to fail because the Parity Check Matrix will have duplicate
lines.  Note that in each case, it discovered the problem without generating all <i>m</i> disk
failures and all <i>s</i> sector failures.  

<hr>
<h3>Grading and helper programs</h3>

Your program does not have to match mine exactly.  Instead, if the given code is JLS, then
your program must print "OK."  If it is not JLS, then it needs to print "No" and give a 
failure scenario that is not recoverable.  It does <i>not</i> have to give the failure
scenario that my program gives. 
<p>
You should error check the input, but I'm not going to grade you on it.  
The TA's may -- that's up to them, and they'll let you know.
The gradescripts will always give legal input.  
<p>
Since enumerations are exponential, the running times of these will blow up.
The gradescript will limit parameters so that my program, when compiled with -O3, takes
less than a second to complete.  If yours takes 5 seconds or more, you are doing something
wrong.  The "incremental" nature of <b>Incremental_Inverse</b> is one of the things that
makes this program fast.  The first version that I wrote simply generated the square matrix
for each failure scenario that had the maximum number of failures, and it was slower than
this one by a factor of 10 to 100.  
<p>
I have a few programs to help you.  They all take the same command line arguments as <b>is_jls</b>.
The first is <b>print_pcm</b>, which simply prints the parity check matrix.  It prints each 
element with <b>printf("%*u ", fw, PCM[i][j])</b>, where <b>fw</b> is 3 when <i>w=8</i>, 
5 when <i>w=16</i> and 10 when <i>w=32</i>.  Here's the example Parity Check Matrix above:

The second program is <b>print_failures</b>.  It prints out every failure scenario that 
<b>is_jls</b> will test.  The third program is <b>test_failures</b>.  It reads failure
scenario strings on standard input, and for each of these, it prints out the tester matrix,
and whether the tester matrix is invertible.  The failure scenario strings can have fewer
than <i>mr+s</i> failures.  When that happens, the tester matrix will not be square, but
the incremental inversion tester will state whether there exists a square matrix containing
that matrix which is invertible, or whether no square matrix containing that matrix will be
invertible.

The gradescript is a combination of my <b>is_jls</b> and <b>test_failures</b>.

<h3>Two final things</h3>

First, use <b>unsigned int</b>'s for matrix elements.  Yes, you can use an <b>unsigned char</b>
for <i>GF(2<sup>8</sup>)</i>, but that will only make your life more difficult.  Simply use
<b>unsigned int</b>'s.
<p>
Second, there is a <b>makefile</b> in this directory that does all compilation for you.
Use it.
